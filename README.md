# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-PySpark
The project topic "Sentiment Analysis using Pyspark in twitter dataset" involves the development of a machine learning system to analyze the sentiment of tweets using the Pyspark framework.

The goal of the project is to build a system that can automatically classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. The system will be trained on a dataset of tweets and their corresponding labels, and will use natural language processing techniques to extract features from the tweets and make predictions about their sentiment.

The system will be implemented using the Pyspark framework, which is a distributed computing platform that is well-suited for large-scale data processing tasks. The system will be able to handle the high volume and velocity of data that is typical of Twitter datasets, and will be able to process and analyze tweets in real-time.

Overall, the project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system that can accurately classify tweets based on their sentiment, and that can be used to gain insights into public opinion, trends, and other phenomena on Twitter.
